# Orphanage Management Oracle Database Project

This project delivers a **3NF-normalized Oracle database** designed to support the key operations of an orphanage, including orphan intake, adoptions, and donations.

Developed as part of a group project, this system includes 15+ interrelated tables, robust constraints, and optimized queries to ensure data integrity, efficiency, and scalability.
